- attackers: source is the attacker and target is the defender
- trades: oriented edges, there could be gifts (check if indegree == outdegree for each node)
- messages are oriented (source is the sender and target is the receiver)
- in messages a small percentage of node has some loop message. Since in Travian there is no possibility to send a message to yourself, we decided to remove this links before performing any task. Also 2 node, who only had self loops were eliminated
