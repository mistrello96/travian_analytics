### DONE

consider 3 gaphs, each of them aggregates the edges of one type (attacks, messages, trades):
	in-degree, out-degree for each node in each graph
		aggregate results can surprise us
	for each graph create a "classic" orinted graph (not a multigraph): the edges will have 2 attributes 
		(type and number of interactions (weight) of that type between the two nodes). We can use this 
		graphes for the demos and centrality analysis: please do note that we still keep 3 separeted graphes

	on the new graphes we can calculate some centrality:
		attacks - degree-centrality (derived from degree distribution)
		messages - betweennes, PageRank
		trades - same as messages
	consider if clustering distribution can give us some type of insight (don't think so) (only for messages and trades)

from these graph we can compute the maximum number of players during the month. Note, for example
		that a player can attack but do not trade: analyze all the graphs and the ids in order to
		know the correct number

Find how many communities have been present for each day

Find relevan communities (at least 10 members) and compute average density and reciprocity over 30 days


### TODO

Plot aggregate measures distribution [Papetti]

Outlier degree analysis

Are there any spam bot (no community, lots of messages)?

find the distribution of activity of each day of the week

COMMUNITY
Find the biggest and most stable community (maximum cardinality over time with minimum variance):[Mistri]
	for each node, for each day, compute centrality (PageRank, closeness (only messages), betweennes(only messages)) and plot mean and sd over time
	for each day, for each node, compute messages degree distribution to find the leader and the recrutier. Consider also other measures.
	for each day, compute community density, reciprocity and plot mean and sd

Evolution over time (using GT):
	consider the evolution over time of the communities
		did they attack each other?
		can we determine when the community has broken? were there a traior (attached someone inside the community) 
		Were there a spy / alliance with other community (messages with other communities)?
		after that, where did they go? did they message some boss in other communities?
		were they at war to each other? were people of a community attacking people of one another? 
		Are attached coordinate over time? Did they strike a single objective or different ones? did they fight back?
	
	look for network growth indicies:
		1. network segmentation
		2. graph densification
		3. diameter shrinkage

COMMUNITY DETECTION?
Since we have GT, we MUST evaluate performance of different community detection approaches
